# Test Plan

**Author**: Michael Hugman (Team 55)

**Revision 2.0 (10-13-2017)**: Added unit tests and results. Changed Unit Test strategy

## 1 Testing Strategy


### 1.1 Overall strategy

* For Unit Test strategy, we plan on doing "Code First" - write the code first and then add tests cases as appropriate during code development

* For Integration Test strategy, we plan on doing "Bottom Up" testing: test the lowest-level modules first, and work out way up to the highest level. 

* For System Test strategy, we plan on doing an array of tests of the system-level performance, including testing of GUI, usability, performance, error handling, load/stress, ad hoc testing

* For Regression Test strategy, for each change introduced in the code, we plan to select from the Unit, Integration, and System tests a subset of priority tests to run first, and then secondary tests after those are completed. 

* To test the UI, we will use manual testing and Espresso test recorder, whereas for non-UI, we will use automated testing

* We plan on sharing responsibility for testing activities, since all team members are taking on the role of Tester

### 1.2 Test Selection

* We will use the following black-box testing techniques: Decision Tables (system, integration), Equivalence Partitioning (unit, integration, system), Boundary Value Analysis (unit, integration, system), Error guessing (unit, integration), use cases (system)

* We will use the following white-box testing techniques: control flow (all levels), data flow (integration, system), branch testing/coverage (system, integration), path testing/coverage (system, integration), statement coverage (unit, integration)

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

* Formulate test obligations, ensure that each obligation is satisfied by at least one test case. 

* Obligations include structural coverage (cover each area of the code), functional coverage (from software specifications), handling typical faults

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

* We will use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancement requests. 

* Features we will use include title/description of the bug/enhancement, labels, assignee, comments, milestones, @mentions

### 1.5 Technology

* We intend to use JUnit for unit and integration testing, Selenium for system testing and regression testing

* Espresso test recorder for UI testing

* EasyMock will be used to mock the EWS service
